			<h1> HISTORY </h1>
			<p> <img id="img01" src="images/Ancient.jpg" alt="A old drawing of people in China playing soccer"> Soccer was first played in China during the second and third centuries B.C. It was called Ts&rsquo;u Chu&#44; Cuji or kickball. The ball used to be the head of their enemies.  They dribbled balls and kicked them into small nets. As soccer advanced they started using leather balls.</p>
			<p> <img id="img02" src="images/SoldiersPlayingSoccer.jfif" alt="Soldiers Playing Soccer"> It is said during medieval times&#44; the old form of soccer allowed kicking, punching and biting. People then grew fond of the game and the competition grew fierce. It got so wild that there were frequent incidents of violence during the game. King Edward III then banned soccer in 1365 due to the many incidents of violence indulged in the sport.</p>
			<p> <img id="img03" src="images/Rules.jpg" alt="Football rules"> In 1851&#44; Cambridge University made new  rules that only allowed tripping and shin kicking. The rules are now called Cambridge Rules. They are also notable for allowing goal kicks&#44; throw-ins&#44; and forward passes. </p>
			<p> <img id="img04" src="images/FAcrest.png" alt="Football Association Crest"> Modern day soccer was established in 1863. In 1869&#44; the Football (Soccer) Association reinforced the rules. Soccer began to spread because British sailors&#44; traders&#44; and soldiers introduced the sport to different parts of the globe.</p>
