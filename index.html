But that is not always the case, sometimes, there are more attackers, or more midfielders but there must only be 11 players."/>The game is played by two teams&#44; with eleven people on each team &#40;including the goalie&#41;. The goal of the game is to kick&#44; or head the ball into the net&#44; touching the ball with your hand or arms is not allowed &#40;unless it was an accident&#41;. This is a sport that requires teamwork with your team. </p>
			<p> A professional soccer game is 90 minutes long. It is split into two halves&#44; 45&#45;minute games and there is a break in between &#40;usually around 15 minutes&#41;. The referee can add any additional minutes of play because of stoppages and injuries in between the game. </p>
